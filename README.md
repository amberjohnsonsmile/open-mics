# Mic Hunter Project proposal

## Project Description

Mic Hunter lists nearby open mic nights and their details in a convenient map view.

## Problem statement

It can be difficult for musicians to find information on when and where open mic nights happen. Even reliable lists don't include the option for a map view.

## How will your project solve this problem?

Map Hunter organizes all that information in one place and allows you to make sense of it in terms of geography.

## Map the user experience

When a user opens Mic Hunter, they will be greeted with a map view and an form where they can enter their zip code. Once they enter their zip code, the map will update with their location and pins representing nearby open mic nights. When the user clicks on a pin, a popup will show information about the time, location, and website for that open mic night. They will also have the option to save that open mic to their favorites list (stretch).

## What technologies do you plan to use?

* Cypress - end-to-end testing
* Mocha/Chai - unit testing
* React - frontend
* MongoDB - database
* Mongoose - database queries
* Request - library for making HTTP calls (web scraper)
* Cheerio - library for traversing DOM (web scraper)
* SASS - CSS organization
* Google Maps API - map view
